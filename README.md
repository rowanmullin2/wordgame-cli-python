# Title
Word Game

# Descripton
This is my CLI recreation of the game 'wordle', I will later add a full UI version in the next iteration.

# Dependancies
python3

# Installation
I will be adding a batch script you can run to install the repo, but for now:
1. Start by creating a new directory/folder or navigate to an old one,
2. next open a terminal window (example: git bash) in the folder
3. Type and enter: "git clone https://github.com/rowanmullin2/wordgame-python.git"
4. Type and enter: "cd wordgame-python"
5. Type and enter: "python app-cli.py"
